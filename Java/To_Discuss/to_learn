1. Autoboxing vs Casting
2. Wrapper Classes
3. How char is a subset of int in Java
4. Work stealing
5. for(;;) infinite loops (used by JVM)
6. Loop unrolling & performance
7. Common loop bugs professionals avoid
8. How compilers optimize loops
9. Why Java forbids some loop tricks C allows
10. “Short loops are frequently coded without
    bodies when the controlling expression can handle all of the details itself.”
11. Explain Integer Caching (-128 - 127)

==========--------------===========
12. Bounded buffer problem
13. Why (while) instead of (if) in interprocess communication in Threads
     - Prevents Spurious Wake-ups
     - Safety rechecking
     - Handles Multiple threads

14. When a thread calls: wait():
      - It Releases the object lock
      - Goes to WAITING state
      - Stops consuming CPU

    When another thread calls: notify():
       - It wakes one waiting thread
       - That thread completes for the lock again

15. How to detect deadlock
16. How to prevent deadlock
17. How (ReentrantLock) helps avoid deadlock

1. What are qualifiers and non-qualifiers

👉 Build a mini validation framework
👉 Build a security interceptor
👉 Build a custom Spring-style annotation scanner

Reflection (how annotations are read)
Spring-style annotation scanning
Or practical backend architecture patterns

Generics

👉 Type erasure (slow & visual)
👉 Wildcards (?) with simple examples
👉 Why List<Object> ≠ List<String>
